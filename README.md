# ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment
Welcome to the repo behind my 6-month live trading experiment where AI models manage a real-money micro-cap portfolio.

**üöÄ Now supports Local LLMs and Google Gemini - No OpenAI dependency required!**

# The Concept
Every day, I kept seeing the same ad about having some A.I. pick undervalued stocks. It was obvious it was trying to get me to subscribe to some garbage, so I just rolled my eyes. 
Then I started wondering, "How well would that actually work?".

So, starting with just $100, I wanted to answer a simple but powerful question:

**Can powerful large language models actually generate alpha (or at least make smart trading decisions) using real-time data?**

## ü§ñ AI Model Support

This experiment now supports multiple AI providers:
- **Local LLMs via Ollama** (Llama 2, Mistral, CodeLlama, etc.) - **Recommended for privacy**
- **Google Gemini** - High-quality cloud-based model
- **No OpenAI dependency** - Run completely independently

### Quick Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Setup local LLM or Gemini:**
   ```bash
   python setup_local_llm.py
   ```

3. **Configure your preferred AI model:**
   - For **Ollama**: Install Ollama and pull a model (`ollama pull llama2`)
   - For **Gemini**: Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `.env` file

4. **Run enhanced analysis:**
   ```bash
   python "Scripts and CSV Files/enhanced_trading_script.py"
   ```

## Each trading day:

- I provide it trading data on the stocks in it's portfolio.

- Strict stop-loss rules apply.

- Everyweek I allow it to use deep research to reevaluate it's account.

- I track and publish performance data weekly on my blog. [SubStack Link](https://substack.com/@nathanbsmith?utm_source=edit-profile-page)

# Why This Matters
AI is being hyped across every industry, but can it really manage money without guidance?

This project is an attempt to find out, with transparency, data, and a real budget.

# Tech Stack
**Core:**
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas + yFinance for data & logic
- Matplotlib for visualizations

**AI Integration:**
- **Ollama** for local LLM models (Llama 2, Mistral, etc.)
- **Google Gemini** for cloud-based AI analysis
- **No OpenAI dependency** - completely independent

**Features:**
- üè† **Local AI Models** - Run everything on your own hardware
- üîí **Privacy-focused** - No data sent to OpenAI
- üìä **Enhanced Analysis** - AI-powered portfolio insights
- üéØ **Multi-model Support** - Choose your preferred AI provider

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- For local models: [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed
- For Gemini: Google API key

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment.git
cd ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup script
python setup_local_llm.py

# Configure your AI provider in .env file
# For Ollama: Set OLLAMA_MODEL=llama2 (or your preferred model)
# For Gemini: Set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Using Local Models (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Ollama (visit https://ollama.ai/)
# Then pull a model:
ollama pull llama2

# Or try other models:
ollama pull mistral
ollama pull neural-chat

# Run the enhanced trading script
python "Scripts and CSV Files/enhanced_trading_script.py"
```

### Using Google Gemini
```bash
# Get API key from Google AI Studio
# Add to .env file: GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run the enhanced trading script
python "Scripts and CSV Files/enhanced_trading_script.py"
```

# Follow Along
The experiment runs June 2025 to December 2025.
Every trading day I will update the portfolio CSV file.
