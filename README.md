# ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment
Welcome to the repo behind my 6-month live trading experiment where AI models manage a real-money micro-cap portfolio.

**üöÄ Fully integrated Local LLMs and Google Gemini - Complete AI-powered analysis throughout!**

# The Concept
Every day, I kept seeing the same ad about having some A.I. pick undervalued stocks. It was obvious it was trying to get me to subscribe to some garbage, so I just rolled my eyes. 
Then I started wondering, "How well would that actually work?".

So, starting with just $100, I wanted to answer a simple but powerful question:

**Can powerful large language models actually generate alpha (or at least make smart trading decisions) using real-time data?**

## ü§ñ AI Model Support

This experiment is **fully integrated** with multiple AI providers throughout the entire application:
- **Local LLMs via Ollama** (Llama 2, Mistral, CodeLlama, etc.) - **Recommended for privacy**
- **Google Gemini** - High-quality cloud-based model
- **No OpenAI dependency** - Run completely independently
- **Auto-provider selection** - Automatically uses the best available AI model
- **Comprehensive integration** - AI analysis in every component

### Quick Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Setup local LLM or Gemini:**
   ```bash
   python setup_local_llm.py
   ```

3. **Configure your preferred AI model:**
   - For **Ollama**: Install Ollama and pull a model (`ollama pull llama2`)
   - For **Gemini**: Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `.env` file

4. **Run enhanced analysis:**
   ```bash
   python run_analysis.py daily
   ```

### üéØ AI Integration Features

The AI is now **fully integrated** throughout the application:

- **üìä Daily Portfolio Analysis** - AI evaluates performance, risk, and opportunities
- **üîç Stock Research** - Deep AI-powered research on individual stocks  
- **üìà Trading Strategy** - AI generates actionable trading recommendations
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management** - AI monitors stop-losses and risk factors
- **üìã Performance Reports** - Comprehensive AI analysis of returns vs benchmarks

### üöÄ Usage Examples

```bash
# Run complete daily analysis with AI insights
python run_analysis.py daily

# Get AI performance analysis
python run_analysis.py performance

# Research a specific stock with AI
python run_analysis.py research ABEO

# Check AI configuration status
python run_analysis.py status

# Use the enhanced trading script
python "Scripts and CSV Files/enhanced_trading_script.py"

## Each trading day:

- I provide it trading data on the stocks in it's portfolio.

- Strict stop-loss rules apply.

- Everyweek I allow it to use deep research to reevaluate it's account.

- I track and publish performance data weekly on my blog. [SubStack Link](https://substack.com/@nathanbsmith?utm_source=edit-profile-page)
